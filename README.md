1. Create a type that is created from an io.Reader, implements io.Reader, and
outputs the contents of the previous io.Reader in the same format as `hexdump -C`.

2. Implement a hex editor that allows users to edit the hex contents of the file,
replacing them with entirely new and different hex contents.
